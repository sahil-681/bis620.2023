The goal of bis620.2023 is to create an R package which is developed
specifically for the BIS620 class in 2023. This package serves as a
comprehensive toolkit for querying, analyzing, and visualizing clinical
trials data, with a focus on clinical trials information. It comprises a
suite of functions and a Shiny application, offering robust tools for
data manipulation and interactive data exploration.

Here are the key components of this package:

- query_kwds: Facilitates data querying based on specific keywords.

- plot_phase_histogram: Generates histograms for clinical trialsâ€™
  phases.

- get_concurrent_trials: Retrieves the count of concurrent trials for
  specified dates.

- plot_concurrent_trials: Visualizes the number of concurrent clinical
  trials over time.

- plot_condition_histogram: Creates histograms for various study
  conditions in the trials.

- plot_sponsor_type_overview: Provides a graphical overview of different
  sponsor types.

- launchApp: Includes an interactive Shiny application for dynamic data
  exploration. The app connects to a DuckDB database, enabling
  interactive querying and visualization of clinical trials data.
